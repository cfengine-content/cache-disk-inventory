#+Title: Cache disk inventory

This policy caches inventory data to
=$(cached_inventory_load.cachedir)/module_protocol/cache_disk_inventory_disk_size.cache=
for the disk volumes found. It requires
[[https://github.com/cfengine-content/cached_inventory][cfengine_content:cached_inventory]] for reporting cached values. This policy does
not require =cf-monitord= in order to work.
